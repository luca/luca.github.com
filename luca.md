title: Hey, I'm Luca
---

I'm a software entrepreneur, striving to find the best tools for the work I'm doing, and looking forward to build systems that are useful and beautiful. 

The method I use to approach and perform successful projects requires working closely with the stakeholders to bridge their needs with the technology to implement them.

During my career  I've learnt that the success of a system depends on the synthesis of technical and non technical issues, and care for any service users is as important as the technology underneath. Iâ€™m passionate about the problem solving activity both for the research and the implementation work and I strive to bring effective solutions to all clients and the teams where I work.
